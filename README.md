# Regression-Project
Welcome to the "Predicting Housing Prices in Boston" project! This repository hosts a comprehensive analysis of the Boston Housing dataset, aiming to predict housing prices in Boston using machine learning techniques.

The dataset comprises various socio-economic factors such as crime rates, property tax rates, and accessibility to highways, offering rich insights into the city's real estate dynamics.

Key Features:

Data Exploration: We kick off the project by conducting thorough data exploration using pandas and numpy, unraveling the dataset's structure, and gaining insights into the distribution and characteristics of the variables.
Data Preprocessing: To prepare the data for modeling, we meticulously handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and perform feature scaling to ensure optimal performance of our machine learning algorithms.
Model Training: Leveraging the powerful scikit-learn library, we employ a Linear Regression model to train on the preprocessed dataset. This model learns the intricate relationships between the input features and the target variable, i.e., the median value of owner-occupied homes (MEDV).
Model Evaluation: Rigorous model evaluation is crucial to gauge the predictive performance accurately. We utilize metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) to assess the model's accuracy in predicting housing prices, providing valuable insights into its robustness and reliability.
Future Scope: As part of ongoing development, we aim to explore advanced machine learning techniques, including ensemble methods and neural networks, to further enhance the predictive capabilities of our model. Additionally, interactive data visualization tools may be incorporated to facilitate a more intuitive understanding of the dataset.
